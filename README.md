# Isle of Wight flood plan 

## Scenario
Extreme flooding is expected on the Isle of Wight and the authority in charge
of planning the emergency response is advising everyone to proceed by foot to
the nearest high ground.
To support this process, the emergency response authority wants you to develop
a software to quickly advise people of the quickest route that they should take
to walk to the highest point of land within a 5km radius.
