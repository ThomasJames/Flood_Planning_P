# Task1: User Input
# The application should ask the user to input their current location as a British National Grid coordinate
# (easting and northing). Then, it should test whether the user is within a box (430000, 80000) and (465000, 95000).
# If the input coor- dinate is outside this box, inform the user and quit the application.
# This is done because the elevation raster provided to you extends only from (425000, 75000) to (470000, 100000) and
# the input point must be at least 5km from the edge of this raster.

    osgb36 = pyproj.Proj("+init=EPSG:27700")

    # Request coordinates from the user.

    east = int(input("Input an eastings coordinate: "))
    north = int(input("Input an nothings coordinate: "))

    # Print the coordinates for reference
    print("Coordinates are ", east, " east and ", north, "north")

    # Assign the coordinates to a shapely point
    coordinate = Point(east, north)
    print(coordinate)

# Task 2: Highest Point Identification
# Identify the highest point within a 5km radius from the user location.
# To successfully complete this task you could (1) use the window function in rasterio to limit the size of your
# elevation array. If you do not use this window you may experience memory issues; or, (2) use a rasterised 5km buffer
# to clip an elevation array. Other solutions are also accepted. Moreover, if you are not capable to solve this task you
# can select a random point within 5km of the user.

    # Work out how much is 5km in coordinates the buffer around the coordinate

    five_km_buffer = coordinate.buffer(5)
#_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________




# Task 3: Nearest Integrated Transport Network
# Identify the nearest Integrated Transport Network (ITN) node to the user and the nearest ITN node to the highest point
# identified in the previous step. To successfully complete this task you could use r-trees.




#_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________







# Task 4: Shortest Path
# Identify the shortest route using Naismith’s rule from the ITN node nearest to the user and the ITN node nearest to
# the highest point. Naismith’s rule states that a reasonably fit person is capable of waking at Page 2 of 5
# 5km/hr and that an additional minute is added for every 10 meters of climb (i.e., ascent not descent).
# To successfully complete this task you could calculate the weight iterating through each link segment. Moreover, if
# you are not capable to solve this task you could (1) approximate this algorithm by calculating the weight using
# only the start and end node elevation; (2) identify the shortest distance from the node nearest the user to the
# node nearest the highest point using only links in the ITN.
# To test the Naismith’s rule, you can use (439619, 85800) as a starting point.

# Task 5: Map Plotting
# Plot a background map 10km x 10km of the surrounding area. You are free to use either a 1:50k Ordnance Survey raster
# (with internal color-map). Overlay a transparent elevation raster with a suitable color-map. Add the user’s starting
# point with a suitable marker, the highest point within a 5km buffer with a suitable marker, and the shortest route
# calculated with a suitable line. Also, you should add to your map, a color-bar showing the elevation range, a north
# arrow, a scale bar, and a legend.

#_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________




# Task 6: Extend the Region
# The position of the user is restricted to a region in where the user must be more than 5km from the edge of the
# elevation raster. Write additional code to overcome this limitation.
