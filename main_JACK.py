    USER INPUT 
    ----------
    The application should ask the user to input their current location as a British National Grid coordinate
    (easting and northing). Then, it should test whether the user is within a box (430000, 80000) and (465000, 95000).
    If the input coor- dinate is outside this box, inform the user and quit the application. This is done because 
    the elevation raster provided to you extends only from (425000, 75000) to (470000, 100000) and the input point
    must be at least 5km from the edge of this raster.

    HIGHEST POINT IDENTIFICATION    
    ----------------------------  
    Identify the highest point within a 5km radius from the user location.
    To successfully complete this task you could (1) use the window function in rasterio to limit the size of your
    elevation array. If you do not use this window you may experience memory issues; or, (2) use a rasterised 5km buffer
    to clip an elevation array. Other solutions are also accepted. Moreover, if you are not capable to solve this task
    you can select a random point within 5km of the user.

    FIND THE SHORTEST ROUTE

    Naismithâ€™s rule states that a reasonably fit person is capable of waking at 5km/hr and that an additional minute 
    is added for every 10 meters of climb (i.e., ascent not descent). To successfully complete this task you could 
    calculate the weight iterating through each link segment. Moreover, if you are not capable to solve this task 
    you could (1) approximate this algorithm by calculating the weight using only the start and end node elevation; 
    (2) identify the shortest distance from the node nearest the user to the node nearest the highest point using only
    inks in the ITN. To test the Naismithâ€™s rule, you can use (439619, 85800) as a starting point.

    PLOTTING

    Plot a background map 10km x 10km of the surrounding area. You are free to use either a 1:50k Ordnance Survey 
    raster (with internal color-map). Overlay a transparent elevation raster with a suitable color-map. Add the userâ€™s
    starting point with a suitable marker, the highest point within a 5km buffer with a suitable marker, and the 
    shortest route calculated with a suitable line. Also, you should add to your map, a color-bar showing the elevation
    range, a north arrow, a scale bar, and a legend.
